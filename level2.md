LEVEL 2

Video 1:
- Organize the outliner:
  - Select donut + Icing
  - Press M and select new collection
  - Repeat with the plane
  - Repeat with cam and light
- Create the first sprinkle
  - UV sphere
    - Segments: 12 (Low Res since it repeats so much will impact render times)
    - Rings (6)
    - Radius: 0.001m (1mm)
    - Elongate:
      - Select with X-ray + E with extrude so that it just elongates
      - S - Z it'll taper the top so that it doesn't look so rounder at the tip
      - Shade smooth so that it doesn't look so flat on the sides
- Duplicate over the surface of the donut
  - Select icing
  - Select Particle pannel
  - Hit + for a new ParticleSetting.
    - Hair for static instance
    - Render as Object
    - Object
      - Select the 1 sprinkle
    - Adjust the size
    - Change the rotation of the particles:
      - Advance
        - Rotation
        - Orientation Axis -> Normal
        - Randomize Phase
    - Ensure they only show on top of the donut and not underneath
      - Weight Paint
      - Disable Particles so that the painting is faster (clicking monitor from the view port)
      - Paint over the icing
    - Link the paint to the particle distribution
      - Vertex Groups
        - Density Group

Video 2:
- Making the sprinkles diffent colors:
  - Shading mode
  - Select sprinkle to see in the node editor
  - Add control:
    - Shift + A -> input -> Object Info
    - Link the Random to the Base color.
      - At this point everything is grey and boring
    - Shift A -> converter -> color ramp in between, use 5 colors.
    - Change from linear to constant so that we do not get in between colors.
  - Randomizing size:
    - Create a new springle twice the size
    - Select both, M -> move to collection
    - Make the particle system to reference the collection
    - We can bend some but using cmd + R and create a loop, scroll wheel and we bend it
  - Add little color balls
    - UV sphere Insert in the saem collection so that it gets applied to the top of the donut
    - Use count and increase the importance of everything else.

Video 3: 
  - Find texture painting at the top.
    - Will split the screen in two 
    - The left side is the un wrapped texture.
    - In there we click new
      - Set the dimensions
      - Give it a name
    - We need to make it rectangular for whatever reason (he won't explain it too well)
    - Currently the donut looks like purple meaning that's missing the texture. So we need to link it
  - Open Shading 
    - Shift + A -> Texture -> image texture
    - connect the colors input and outputs.
    - Image texture we just select the texture we just created above
    - Now they're linked so the donut should look black on the right side as the texture on the left
  - Save image separately than blend file
  - N key opens the color pallette.
  - We paint the donut same color as before
  - We cound paint it white but it'll look too obvious that it's painted we actually want to paint with a texture
  - Now we want to actually paint with a texture:
    - left panel -> Texture Mask -> click new -> give it a name
    - right panel -> Texture Panel -> brush mask -> find the texture -> type clouds
    - left panel -> make mapping -> Random -> Makes the paining more natural
  - We pain the actual donut:
    - We change it to black on the left side
    - Brush setting ->

Video 4: Procedural Texturing 
  - Shading mode, same we use for image painting.
  - We want to add a "Procedural Texturing" computer generated
  - ADDING INITIAL TEXTURE
    - Shift + A -> Texture -> Noise Texture
    - Edit -> preference -> Add ons -> node wrangler. This makes it so that you can more easily see what the node does to the render
    - Control + shift + left click -> preview the node over the model
    - We want to use the fac (factor, which initialy looks black and white) to drive the texture of the donut.
  - MAKE TEXTURE UNIFORM
  - Shif+ A -> input -> Texture Coordinate:  
    - Object output into the vector noise texture.
    - Change the scale on the noise texture
  - ADD BUMP EFFECT
    - Shift + A -> Vector -> Displacement
    - Fac output from noice Texturing -> displacement node height input
    - displacement node displacement output -> displacement input (of the material output)
    - Use actual render mode to see the texture.
  - MAKE THE DISPLACEMENT REAL (changes shape and size of mesh):
    - Material properties on the right -> surface -> Displacement -> Displacement and Bump
    - It'll look like a porkypine
    - We reduce the scale of the displacement node until the texture looks adequate.
    - Increate detail in the noise texture to get smaller details.

Video 5: Improve on the Texturing.
  - ADD LARGE SCALE DETAILS (Adding multiple textures)
    - We added small bumps but now we want to add larger bumps which we can control by using another texture
    - Duplicate the Noise Texture
    - Output of Texture Coordinate into new vector noise texture
    - Control + shift + left click
    - Scale is 200 (vs 1500 on the previous one) this is what makes it bigger.
    - Connect output of new noise texture into displacement node overrides the previous one so:
  - MIXING BOTH TEXTURES INTO ONE OUPUT
    - Shift + A -> color -> Mix RBG node
    - Take the FAC from both noise textures and use them as input into the Mix node
    - Color of the mix hooks into the Height input of the displacement
    - The mix node we need to change the blend type to ADD -> fac to 1
      - We want both textures simultaneously not a really a weighted mix
  - MAKING THE LARGER NODE OUTPUT A BIT CLEANER:
    - We'll be adding a color ramp only for the big bump node
    - 
    - Color ramp node, noise texture fac into fac input
    - color output into the mixer
    - simple linear RGB
  - BUMPS SHOULD INFLUENCE THE COLOR TOO (in addition to size)
    - WE could get the color output of the mixer and add it into the Principled BSDF but that only takes 1 color
    - Insert another Mix RBG color node
    - Output of the mix into the fac of the new mix
    - Change the mix value to overlay
    - choose a orangish darker color to see the texture better.
  - FINAL SUGGESTIONS:
    - Make the weight pain more random
    - Add and RGM MIX mix in between the texture and the overlay in case we can to override the original texture painting.
